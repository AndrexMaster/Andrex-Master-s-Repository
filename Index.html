                            When you add this character to the game, you doom yourself to a lot of dirty tricks on his part, it will be an arson of the forest or an explosion of your house. Let this character need to be added to the manual; anyway, he will take revenge there</p>

                <p class="p_2">*Zombie*This is a standard monster that was added to the game a little later than the game came out.
                        It appears at night or where there is very low lightness (cellars, caves, dungeons).</p>
